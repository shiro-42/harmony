# Harmony

Create your application from the ground up using no code.
To proof Harmony work we built the ui using itself.

## Cool ideas

- Use the same code to build the UI and the backend

## Concepts

Node: Have an internal state, a list of edges and can inherit a context
Edge: defines the relationship between source and sink
Socket: the type of the edge
